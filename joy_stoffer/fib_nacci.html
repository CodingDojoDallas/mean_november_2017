    <!-- Assignment: Fib + Nacci
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence where each number is the sum of its two predecessors. The sequence starts off like so: (0), 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc. The 0 is in parenthesis because it helps the sequence get started but it is not actually part of the sequence.

Using Closures make the Fib function with the following specifications: -->


<!-- // Here we have a function called "Outer"
function Outer() {
      // There is a count variable that is scoped to the function
  var count = 0;
      // There is an inner function that increments count and then console.logs it
  function inner() {
        // increment count
    count++
        // console.log count
    console.log(count);
  }
      // return the inner function! We can return a function!
  return inner
}
// counter is now the function returned from invoking Outer
var counter = Outer();
              // if we invoke the counter function
counter()     // this will console.log "1"
counter()     // this will console.log "2"
counter()     // this will console.log "3"
counter()     // this will console.log "4"
              // So that means that the count variable still exists!
              // and it is being changed even though we aren't inside of the Outer function!
                   // What if we try to access count out here?
console.log(count) // doesn't work! -->
